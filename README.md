<p>Welcome to my Power BI showcase - where data meets design. Each project reflects my passion for creating intuitive, visually engaging dashboards that bring data to life and support smarter decision-making.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ“ˆ Project 1: Cool Cola </h2>
  <p>This Power BI report was created to showcase modern and engaging <strong>dashboard design techniques</strong> using realistic business data. It simulates the sales and consumer analytics of a fictional beverage brand, <strong>Cool Cola</strong>, inspired by global leaders in the soft drink industry. The report features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sales Analytics:</strong>
      A visually rich breakdown of product performance, seasonal sales patterns, and market differences across eight European countries.</li>
    <li><strong>Consumer Survey:</strong>
      A monthly overview of beverage preferences by gender, age group, and product type-highlighting demographic trends and purchasing behavior.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This project focuses on <strong>visual storytelling</strong>, layout creativity, and clarity in data communication using advanced Power BI visuals and design elements.</p>
