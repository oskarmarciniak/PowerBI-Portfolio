## ✨ Interesting Graphic Solutions

This report includes several advanced UI/UX solutions that enhance usability, user engagement, and overall experience.

---

<h3>🔍 Filter Panel</h3>

- A **hidden filter pane** is available on each page.
- It can be revealed via a dedicated button and allows users to interactively filter the data based on various dimensions.
- The filter panel is designed to stay out of sight until needed, preserving visual clarity.

---

<h3>ℹ️ Information Tooltips</h3>

- Every page features **interactive tooltips** that display contextual information when hovering over or clicking on specific visuals.
- These tooltips help users interpret the data without cluttering the report.

---

<h3>🔘 Button Behavior with Hover Descriptions</h3>

- Most **buttons** in the report (except the **info button** used for triggering tooltips) are designed with **hover-activated descriptions**.
- When the user hovers over a button, a short tooltip appears describing the **exact action** that will happen upon clicking — for example:
  - "Switch to dark mode"
  - "Open filter panel"
  - "Go to product overview"
- This helps ensure clarity for all user interactions and provides intuitive, guided navigation through the report.

<h3>🌊 Liquid Visual for KPI Indicator</h3>

- The **main KPI** is presented using a custom **liquid fill visual**, which enhances the visual appeal and aligns with the overall **theme and “climate” of the report**.
- The liquid inside the circle dynamically **moves and animates** depending on the percentage value, providing a real-time visual cue of performance.
- This technique blends data visualization with subtle animation to make key metrics stand out without overwhelming the viewer.

---

<h3>🧃 Product Table with Dynamic Images</h3>

- A dedicated **table of beverage products** is included within the report.
- This table features **embedded product images** next to their names and KPIs.
- As users apply filters, **the image rows automatically re-sort** based on the selected data, preserving consistent layout while dynamically adapting to the context.
- This allows for an engaging visual representation of product-level performance, enhanced with real-world imagery.

---

<h3>🌗 Light/Dark Mode Switching</h3>

- Each page of the report includes a **light/dark mode switcher**.
- Clicking this switcher redirects the user to an alternative version of the same page, styled in the selected color mode (light or dark).
- This design accommodates users' visual preferences and improves readability across devices.
