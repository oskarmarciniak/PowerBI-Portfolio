<h3>üåä Liquid Visual for KPI Indicator</h3>

- The **main KPI** is presented using a custom **liquid fill visual**, which enhances the visual appeal and aligns with the overall **theme and report‚Äôs visual identity**.
- The liquid inside the circle dynamically **moves and animates** depending on the percentage value, providing a real-time visual cue of performance.
- This technique blends data visualization with subtle animation to make key metrics stand out without overwhelming the viewer.

<h3>üßÉ Product Table with Dynamic Images</h3>

- A dedicated **table of beverage products** is included within the report.
- This table features **embedded product images** next to their names and results.

- This allows for an engaging visual representation of product-level performance, enhanced with real-world imagery.

<h3>‚ÑπÔ∏è Information Tooltips</h3>

<h3>üîç Filter Panel</h3>

- It can be revealed via a dedicated button and allows users to interactively filter the data based on various dimensions.

- The filter panel contains a window showing the currently used filters and a button to reset all used filters.
- Applied filters work on all pages of the report.

<h3>üîò Button Behavior with Hover Descriptions</h3>

- Most **buttons** in the report (except the **info button** used for triggering tooltips) are designed with **hover-activated descriptions**.
- When the user hovers over a button, a short tooltip appears describing the **exact action** that will happen upon clicking ‚Äî for example:
  - "Switch to dark mode"
  - "Open filter window"
  - "Enter ... page"
- This helps ensure clarity for all user interactions and provides intuitive, guided navigation through the report.

<h3>üåó Light/Dark Mode Switching</h3>

- This design accommodates users' visual preferences and improves readability across devices.
